title: Project settings overview

## Purpose

Project settings let you manage governance controls at the project level.

## Why this matters

Governance-by-design is easier when project controls (roles, categories, agent configuration) are explicit and consistently applied.

## Who can use it

- **View settings:** all project members
- **Modify settings:** **Project Owner**

## Before you begin

- Open the relevant project workspace.

## Steps

1. Open **Projects**.
2. Select the project.
3. In the project workspace, use the tabs:
   - **Access control**
   - **Document categories**
   - **Agent configuration**

## Expected results

- You can view project settings.
- Project Owners can save changes and see them reflected across the project.

## Common issues

- **Read-only**: only Project Owners can modify project settings.

## Tips

- Review settings at project kickoff to align with PMO standards.
