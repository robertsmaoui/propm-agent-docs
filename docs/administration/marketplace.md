title: Marketplace (subscriptions and seats)
---

## Purpose

The **Marketplace** page provides visibility into subscription and seat information.

## Why this matters

Licensing visibility helps enterprises align access control and procurement (who has access, how many seats are available).

## Who can use it

- **Tenant Admin**
- **Project Owner**

## Before you begin

- Sign in with an account that has Marketplace access.

## Steps

### View subscriptions

1. Open **Marketplace**.
2. Review subscription details:
   - Plan
   - Seat usage
   - Status
   - Billing cycle
3. (Optional) Use **Export** to download the table as CSV.

### Create a subscription (only when instructed)

Some deployments expose a **Create subscription** button.

1. Select **Create subscription**.
2. Enter the requested values.
3. Select **Create**.

> In most Azure Marketplace purchase flows, subscriptions are created automatically. Only use manual creation if your administrator instructs you to.

## Expected results

- Subscriptions are visible in the list.
- Seat usage shows used/total and available seats.

## Common issues

- **You can’t see Marketplace in the menu**: your account may not have the required admin role.
- **Create subscription fails**: verify the values, then retry.

## Tips

- Use CSV export for procurement reconciliation and internal reporting.
