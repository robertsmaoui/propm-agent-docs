title: Access control (project members and roles)
---

## Purpose

Access control lets Project Owners manage:

- Who is a member of the project
- Which project role each member has

## Why this matters

Role-based access control supports the principle of least privilege, reduces risk, and strengthens audit readiness.

## Who can use it

- **View membership:** all project members
- **Manage membership and roles:** **Project Owner**

## Before you begin

- Open the project workspace.
- Confirm you are a Project Owner for the project.

## Steps

### Add or update a member

1. In the project workspace, open **Access control**.
2. Enter the user’s **email**.
3. Select a **role**:
   - Owner
   - Manager
   - Contributor
   - Viewer
   - Auditor
4. Select **Add / Update member**.

### Change an existing member’s role

1. In **Access control**, find the member row.
2. Use the role dropdown to select the new role.

### Remove a member

1. In **Access control**, find the member row.
2. Select **Remove**.

## Expected results

- The member list updates.
- The user’s permissions update based on their role.

## Common issues

- **You cannot remove yourself**: the UI prevents self-removal to avoid accidental lockout.
- **Access denied**: you are not a Project Owner for this project.

## Tips

- Grant Owner role only to users responsible for project governance.
- Use Viewer/Auditor roles for stakeholders who need read-only access.
