title: Custom agents
---

## Purpose

Custom agents let Project Owners create project-specific assistants with tailored instructions.

## Why this matters

Custom agents support standardization by embedding repeatable guidance into the workspace (for example, a stakeholder communications style or governance checklist).

## Who can use it

- **Create and delete custom agents:** **Project Owner**
- **Chat with custom agents:** project members with permission to run agents

## Before you begin

- Select a project.

## Steps

### Create a custom agent

1. Open **Agents**.
2. Select **Create agent**.
3. Enter:
   - **Name**
   - **Role / instructions**
   - **Scope**
4. Select **Create**.

> Custom agents are typically **project-scoped**. If your environment does not support other scopes, select “Project only”.

### Delete a custom agent

1. In the agent roster, find an agent marked as **custom**.
2. Select the trash icon.
3. Confirm **Delete**.

## Expected results

- The custom agent appears in the roster.
- You can chat with it like a built-in agent.

## Common issues

- **Create fails**: confirm you are a Project Owner and that the selected scope is supported.

## Tips

- Write instructions as “what good looks like” (tone, structure, required fields).
