title: Portfolio Command Center
---

## Purpose

The **Portfolio Command Center** provides a cross-project entry point.

Depending on your deployment configuration, it may show:

- A portfolio snapshot (cards and executive summary), and/or
- A project directory you can use to open workspaces quickly

## Why this matters

Portfolio views support decision-ready visibility by reducing the time needed to locate project context and review project health at scale.

## Who can use it

- **All signed-in users**

## Before you begin

- Sign in.

## Steps

1. Open **Portfolio Command Center**.
2. Review the portfolio snapshot if available.
3. Use the **Projects** table to:
   - Open a project workspace
   - Jump directly to Knowledge, Agents, or AI Log for a project

## Expected results

- You can quickly navigate across projects.

## Common issues

- **Snapshot not available**: some environments may only show the projects list.
- **Projects list fails to load**: refresh and check the Health indicator.

## Tips

- Use this page as a “command center” when you need to review multiple projects in a short time.
