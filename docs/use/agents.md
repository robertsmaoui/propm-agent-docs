title: Agents (chat)
---

## Purpose

**Agents** lets you chat with specialized assistants in the context of a project.

## Why this matters

Agents reduce manual reporting overhead by accelerating drafting, analysis, and structured outputs—while keeping work traceable through runs and activity.

## Who can use it

- **View agent roster:** all project members
- **Run agents (chat):** Project Owner, Project Manager, Contributor
- **Create/delete custom agents:** Project Owner

## Before you begin

- Select a project.
- (Recommended) Upload key documents into **Knowledge** to ground the project context.

## Steps

### Open Agents for a project

1. Open **Agents**.
2. If prompted, select a project from the list.

### Start an agent chat

1. Select an agent in the **Agent roster**.
2. Type your prompt.
3. Send the message.
4. Review the response.
   - When available, responses include **Sources**.

### Manage chat history

1. Use **New** to start a new chat.
2. Use **Rename** to give a chat a clearer title.
3. Use **Delete** to remove a chat from this browser.

## Expected results

- The agent responds.
- Runs can be reviewed later in **AI Log**.

## Common issues

- **Access denied**: your project role may be read-only.
- **Offline status**: real-time connectivity may be unavailable; you can still retry the action or refresh.
- **Voice input not supported**: voice input depends on your browser.

## Tips

- Start with **Virtual Project Manager** for routing and synthesis.
- Ask for structured output (for example: “Give me 5 risks with owner, trigger, mitigation”).
