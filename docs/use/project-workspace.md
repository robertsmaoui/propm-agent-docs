title: Project workspace
---

## Purpose

The **project workspace** is the central place to work within a project.

It combines:

- A project header (name, description, status)
- A **workspace chat** (agent chat in the context of the project)
- Project settings tabs (access control, categories, agent configuration)

## Why this matters

Keeping work project-scoped supports governance and audit readiness: you can trace runs, documents, and outputs back to a specific project.

## Who can use it

- **View the workspace and chat:** all project members
- **Change project settings:** **Project Owner**

## Before you begin

- You must have access to the project.
- Open a project workspace from **Projects**.

## Steps

### Use workspace chat

1. In the project workspace, find **Workspace chat**.
2. Select an agent from the dropdown.
3. Type your prompt and send it.
4. (Optional) Use **voice input** if your browser supports it.

### Review or manage project settings

1. Use the tabs:
   - **Agent configuration**
   - **Access control**
   - **Document categories**
2. If you are not a Project Owner, the settings areas are read-only.

## Expected results

- The selected agent responds in the chat.
- Project Owners can update settings and see the changes reflected across the project.

## Common issues

- **Read-only warning**: only Project Owners can change settings.
- **Voice input not available**: voice input depends on browser capabilities.

## Tips

- Start with **Virtual Project Manager** when you are unsure which specialist agent to use.
- Use **Document categories** to align the project’s taxonomy with your PMO.
