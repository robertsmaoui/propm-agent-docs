## Purpose

This page explains how ProPM Agent is organized and how to navigate the application efficiently.

## Why this matters

ProPM Agent is **project-scoped**. Picking the right project context is the difference between working with the correct knowledge base, agents, PM Docs, and AI Log.

## Who can use it

- **All signed-in users**

## Before you begin

- Sign in to ProPM Agent.

## Steps

1. Use the left navigation to move between core areas:
   - **Dashboard**
   - **Projects**
   - **Knowledge**
   - **Agents**
   - **PM Docs**
   - **AI Log**

2. Use the **Project Switcher** (top bar) to set your current project.
   - When a project is selected, ProPM Agent uses it as the context for most pages.

3. Use the command palette:
   - Press **Ctrl+K** (Windows) or **⌘K** (macOS)
   - Type a page name (for example “Projects” or “AI Log”) and select it.

4. Check **Notifications** (bell icon) for important project events.

5. Use **Health** to confirm whether the app is connected and responding.

## Expected results

- You can quickly switch projects and confirm you are working in the correct context.
- You can find core capabilities (Knowledge, Agents, PM Docs, AI Log) without searching.

## Common issues

- **Marketplace is not visible in the menu**: Marketplace is only visible to users with specific admin roles.
- **A page says “Select a project first”**: select a project using the Project Switcher or open a project workspace from **Projects**.

## Tips

- Use **AI Log** when you need traceability (runs + activity timeline).
- Use **Export** on tables (when available) to download a CSV for offline review.
