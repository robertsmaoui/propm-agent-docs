title: Dashboard

## Purpose

The **Dashboard** provides a quick overview of your work: projects, current project context, and recent activity.

## Why this matters

Dashboards support decision-ready visibility by making it easier to see “what changed” and where to take action.

## Who can use it

- **All signed-in users**

## Before you begin

- Sign in.
- To see project-specific stats, select a project.

## Steps

1. Open **Dashboard**.
2. If no project is selected, use the **Project Switcher** to choose one.
3. Review:
   - **Documents (Knowledge)** count
   - **Agent runs** and **Activity** count
   - **Quick links** to Knowledge, Agents, PM Docs, and AI Log
4. Review **Recent Activity** and open **AI Log** for details.

## Expected results

- When a project is selected, dashboard cards show project-specific counts and shortcuts.
- Recent events provide an audit-friendly summary of what happened.

## Common issues

- **Values show “—”**: select a project to populate project-scoped stats.

## Tips

- Use the dashboard as a “start of day” check to reduce manual status gathering.
