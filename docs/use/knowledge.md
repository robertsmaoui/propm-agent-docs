title: Knowledge (documents + search)
---

## Purpose

**Knowledge** is your project’s document library and search experience.

You can:

- Upload project documents
- Track ingestion/indexing status
- Search your project knowledge with source references

## Why this matters

Knowledge standardizes how evidence is stored and retrieved, reducing manual effort and improving audit readiness.

## Who can use it

- **View documents and search:** Project Owner, Project Manager, Contributor, Viewer, Auditor
- **Upload documents:** Project Owner, Project Manager, Contributor

## Before you begin

- Select a project.
- Prepare the file(s) you want to upload.

## Steps

### Upload a document

1. Open **Knowledge**.
2. Select a **category**.
3. Select a file.
4. Select **Upload**.
5. Select **Refresh** to update the list.

### Check ingestion / indexing status

1. In **Knowledge**, review the **Status** column.
2. Wait until the document moves to an “indexed” or “ready” type status before expecting it to appear in search.

### Search project knowledge

1. In **Search**, enter a question or keywords.
2. Select **Search**.
3. Review results:
   - The **snippet** (the matched content)
   - The **source** reference (where the snippet came from)
   - Optional page/section information (when available)

## Expected results

- Uploaded documents appear in the list.
- Search returns results with source references to support verification.

## Common issues

- **Document not searchable yet**: indexing can take time after upload.
- **Upload fails**: confirm you have a role that allows uploads.
- **Search fails**: retry, then capture the trace ID (if shown) and contact your administrator.

## Tips

- Keep categories stable to support portfolio comparability.
- Use search results as evidence: verify important outputs by reviewing the referenced sources.
