## Purpose

**Projects** is where you browse project workspaces and (if allowed) create new projects.

## Why this matters

Projects are the core unit of standardization: knowledge, agent runs, PM Docs, and activity are tracked per project.

## Who can use it

- **Browse projects / open workspaces:** all users with project access
- **Create projects:** **Project Owner**

## Before you begin

- Sign in.

## Steps

### Browse and open a project workspace

1. Open **Projects**.
2. Use the table search to filter by name/description.
3. Select a project row to open its **workspace**.

### Create a project (Project Owner)

1. Open **Projects**.
2. Select **Create project**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** (required)
   - **Description** (optional)
   - **Project ID** (optional)
4. Select **Create**.

## Expected results

- The project appears in the list.
- The workspace opens for the newly created project.

## Common issues

- **You don’t see “Create project”**: your account does not have the **Project Owner** role.
- **You can’t open a project**: you may not be a member of that project.

## Tips

- Use **Export** on the Projects table to create a CSV snapshot for PMO reporting.
- Use a consistent naming standard so projects remain comparable.
