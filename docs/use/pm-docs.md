title: PM Docs (edit + export DOCX)
---

## Purpose

**PM Docs** are project artefacts you can review, edit, and export to DOCX.

## Why this matters

PM Docs support standardization and audit readiness by keeping key project artefacts in a controlled, traceable workspace.

## Who can use it

- **View and download DOCX:** all project members
- **Edit and add to Knowledge:** Project Owner, Project Manager, Contributor
- **Delete:** Project Owner, Project Manager

## Before you begin

- Select a project.
- Ensure your project has PM Docs available.

## Steps

### Find and filter PM Docs

1. Open **PM Docs**.
2. Use filters (title/category/creator/status) and sorting to find the right document.

### Edit a PM Doc

1. Select **Edit** on the row.
2. Update:
   - **Title**
   - **Status** (draft/final)
   - **Category**
   - **Source (Markdown)**
3. Select **Save**.

### Export a DOCX

1. Select **Download DOCX**.
2. Save the file.

### Add a PM Doc to Knowledge (optional)

1. Select **Add to Knowledge**.
2. Confirm the document shows **In Knowledge**.

## Expected results

- Updates are saved.
- DOCX exports download successfully.
- Added PM Docs can be treated as part of project Knowledge.

## Common issues

- **No PM Docs found**: your project may not have any PM Docs yet.
- **Add to Knowledge is disabled**: the PM Doc has already been added.
- **Delete fails**: your role may not allow deletion.

## Tips

- Use **final** status for documents that are ready for stakeholder distribution.
- Use **Add to Knowledge** to make key artefacts searchable.
