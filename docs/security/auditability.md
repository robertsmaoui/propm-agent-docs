title: Auditability and accountability

ProPM Agent provides audit-friendly visibility through the UI.

## What is recorded (user-facing)

- Agent runs (status and details)
- Project activity events (uploads, updates, and other actions)

These are visible in **AI Log**.

## Trace IDs

Some screens show a **trace ID**. If you need help from an administrator, sharing the trace ID can help locate the relevant activity.

## Why this matters

Auditability supports governance reviews and compliance needs.
