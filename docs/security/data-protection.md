## Encryption in transit

ProPM Agent uses HTTPS/TLS for encrypted communication between users and the application.

## Encryption at rest

Customer data is stored using Azure managed services that support encryption at rest.

## Customer data residency

In a Managed Application deployment, ProPM Agent resources run in **your Azure tenant and subscription**.

## Why this matters

These protections support enterprise privacy expectations and reduce risk of data exposure.
