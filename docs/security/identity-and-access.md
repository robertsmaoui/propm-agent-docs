title: Identity and access control
---

ProPM Agent is designed for enterprise identity and access control.

## Identity

- Users sign in using **Microsoft Entra ID**.
- Your organization manages sign-in eligibility using Entra users and groups.

## Roles

ProPM Agent uses roles to apply the principle of least privilege.

### Tenant-level roles

Some admin capabilities require tenant-level roles (for example, Marketplace visibility).

### Project roles

Within each project, access is scoped by project roles such as:

- **Owner**
- **Manager**
- **Contributor**
- **Viewer**
- **Auditor**

## Why this matters

Role scoping reduces risk and supports governance by ensuring users only see and do what they need to.
