title: Why Managed Applications?
---

ProPM Agent is deployed from **Azure Marketplace** as a **Managed Application**.

In simple terms:

- Your organization **purchases and deploys** the application from Marketplace.
- The application’s resources are deployed into **your Azure subscription**.
- Azure provides a consistent way to manage the application lifecycle (updates, visibility, governance).

## Why this matters

Managed Applications support enterprise procurement and governance expectations:

- **Procurement simplicity**: Marketplace ordering and subscription controls.
- **Consistent deployment model**: repeatable, standardized deployment process.
- **Tenant isolation**: your deployment runs within your Azure tenant and subscription.
- **Security review alignment**: Azure-native patterns and controls.
- **Operational visibility**: your admins can view deployed resources and health signals.

## What you should expect

After deployment, you will typically have:

- A **web application URL** (for end users)
- A **single API entry point** (for the web app)

Most internal services and data services are not directly exposed.
