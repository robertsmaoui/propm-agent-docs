title: What is ProPM Agent?
---

ProPM Agent is a web application that helps teams run project workspaces with **shared knowledge**, **AI assistance**, and **traceable activity**.

At a high level, you:

1. **Create or open a project**.
2. **Upload documents** into the project’s Knowledge base.
3. **Ask agents** to help you draft, analyze, or structure project content.
4. **Review outputs** (including downloadable project documents when available).
5. **Track runs and activity** in an audit-friendly way.

## Designed for enterprise deployment

ProPM Agent is typically deployed from **Azure Marketplace** as a **Managed Application** into your organization’s Azure subscription.

This approach supports enterprise expectations such as tenant isolation, consistent deployment, and alignment with security review processes.
