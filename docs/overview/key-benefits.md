title: Key benefits (governance-by-design)

## Standardization

ProPM Agent helps teams work in a consistent structure across projects:

- Projects follow the same navigation and core workflows.
- Document categories can be configured to match your PMO taxonomy.
- Outputs can be stored as project artefacts (PM Docs) and exported to DOCX.

## Governance-by-design

Governance is supported through product behaviors that reduce “hidden work”:

- Project membership and roles are explicit.
- Project Owners can control agent availability and parameters.
- Activity and AI runs are visible through the AI Log.

## Decision-ready visibility

ProPM Agent provides visibility into what happened and when:

- Agent runs include status and (when available) citations.
- Activity events can be reviewed in a project timeline.
- Portfolio Command Center provides a cross-project entry point.

## Reduced reporting overhead

Instead of repeatedly recreating project context, teams can:

- Upload knowledge once and search it when needed.
- Use agents to accelerate drafting and structuring.
- Reuse exported artefacts in existing reporting routines.
