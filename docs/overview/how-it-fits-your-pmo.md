title: How ProPM Agent fits with your PMO
---

ProPM Agent is designed to work alongside existing PMO processes:

- **Project Owners** set up projects, roles, and governance settings.
- **Project Managers** use Knowledge + Agents to accelerate day-to-day execution and project communications.
- **Contributors** add project documents and collaborate on content.
- **Viewers/Auditors** review outputs and activity.

## Portfolio-level entry point

The **Portfolio Command Center** provides a cross-project view and quick navigation to key project workspaces.

Depending on your deployment configuration, it may show an enhanced portfolio snapshot or a project directory view.
