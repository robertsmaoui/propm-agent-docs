title: Sign-in issues
---

## Symptoms

- You cannot sign in.
- Sign-in works, but you see an error page.

## What to check

1. Confirm you are using the correct ProPM Agent URL.
2. Confirm your account is allowed to sign in (your organization controls this in Entra ID).
3. If you see a redirect error, ask your tenant admin to confirm the application registration has the correct redirect URI.

## If the issue persists

- Capture any displayed **trace ID**.
- Contact your tenant administrator.
