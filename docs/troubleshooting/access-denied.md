title: Permissions and “Access denied”
---

## Symptoms

- You can sign in, but actions fail with “Access denied”.
- You cannot upload documents, run agents, or edit settings.

## Common causes

- You are not a member of the selected project.
- Your role is read-only (Viewer/Auditor).
- You are trying to perform a Project Owner–only action (membership, categories, agent configuration).

## What to do

1. Confirm you selected the correct project.
2. Ask the project’s **Project Owner** to add you and assign the appropriate role.
3. If your organization uses seat-based licensing enforcement, confirm you have an assigned seat.
