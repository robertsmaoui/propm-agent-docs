title: ProPM Agent documentation
---

ProPM Agent helps project teams and PMOs run **project workspaces** with:

- **Knowledge** (document upload + search with sources)
- **AI agents** (project-specific chat and runs)
- **PM Docs** (project artefacts you can edit and export to DOCX)
- **AI Log** (runs and activity timeline)

These docs are written for **business users** and **tenant administrators** who deploy ProPM Agent from **Azure Marketplace**.

## What you can do with ProPM Agent

- Create and browse projects
- Upload project documents and search them
- Chat with specialized agents (including a “Virtual Project Manager”)
- Review AI runs and activity for audit-friendly visibility
- Manage project membership and roles (Project Owner)
- Configure project document categories and agent settings (Project Owner)

## How the product is organized

ProPM Agent is **project-scoped**:

1. You select a project.
2. You upload knowledge and run agents in that project context.
3. Outputs and activity are tracked per project.
